# Credit_card_fraud_data
## Introduction
Credit card fraud is an urgent issue in the financial industry, with global losses estimated at up to USD 28.65 billion in 2021. Studies show that every dollar lost to fraud actually costs businesses an average of USD 3.75, representing a 20% increase compared to 2019. This results in significant financial and reputational damage: if fraud is not detected in time, both banks and customers may suffer serious losses, lose trust, and even face regulatory penalties.

Therefore, accurate and timely credit card fraud detection and prevention strategies play a crucial role in protecting revenue and maintaining institutional credibility. Moreover, transaction datasets are typically very large and highly imbalanced (with fraudulent transactions representing only a tiny proportion, for example about 0.172% in commonly used datasets), which requires models to be both fast and highly sensitive. Consequently, developing accurate predictive models is essential to minimize financial losses and ensure the security of payment systems.

## Credit card fraud detection data analysis

**During the process of collecting data for research on Credit Card Fraud Detection, it is well understood that searching for datasets related to credit card information is highly sensitive.**

- **First dataset [ECC – European Credit Card]**:
This dataset was collected by the Machine Learning Group of the Université Libre de Bruxelles in collaboration with Worldline. It contains 284,807 anonymized credit card transactions; however, only 492 of them are fraudulent, resulting in a highly imbalanced dataset. The imbalance ratio is 1:578, corresponding to a positive ratio of 0.173%.

- **Second dataset [IEEE – CIS]**:
This dataset was provided by Vesta Corporation as part of a competition organized in collaboration with IEEE-CIS. It is a very large dataset with over 1 million transactions and a significant imbalance ratio of 1:35 (approximately 3.5%, which is lower than that of the ECC dataset). However, it is highly complex, containing more than 434 features and a large number of missing values.

- **Third dataset [Simulated]**:
This dataset is publicly available on the Kaggle platform. It consists of synthetic data generated by simulating transaction information from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. Although it is a large dataset, its accuracy and realism compared to real-world data are relatively low.

To better reflect real-world conditions, align with the research objectives, and ensure an appropriate length for the report, we choose to use the first dataset (ECC) and exclude the second dataset (IEEE) and the third dataset (Simulated).
